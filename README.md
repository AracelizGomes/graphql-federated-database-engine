# GFDE â€” GraphQL Federated Database Engine

> Kernel-level federation for GraphQL with direct memory execution

- --

## ðŸš€ Overview

- *GFDE (GraphQL Federated Database Engine)** is an open source project that reimagines GraphQL federation as a **database-native concept**.

Instead of stitching services at the middleware layer (e.g., Apollo Federation), GFDE integrates federation directly into the **execution kernel** and introduces a **Direct Memory Execution Protocol (DMEP)** for fast, low-latency query traversal across distributed data sources.

GFDEâ€™s mission is to eliminate the **N+1 problem**, reduce network overhead, and provide **scalable GraphQL federation** purpose-built for modern distributed systems.

## Key Features 

- **Kernel-Level Federation** â€“ GraphQL federation logic is embedded in the query engine itself.
- **Direct Memory Execution Protocol (DMEP)** â€“ Sub-queries are joined in memory, bypassing network marshalling overhead.
- **Federated Query Planner** â€“ Optimized decomposition of GraphQL queries across heterogeneous data sources (SQL, NoSQL, KV, Graph).
- **Unified Schema Registry** â€“ Maintains cross-service schema consistency and runtime conflict resolution.
- **Performance Benchmarking Harness** â€“ Compare GFDE against Apollo Federation and monolithic GraphQL.

## GFDE Performance in Context

In simulated benchmarks (identical schema/data/hardware):

| Architecture | p95 @ 200 RPS | p95 @ 800 RPS | Peak QPS under 200ms p95 | Notes |

|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|-------|

| Apollo Federation | ~120ms | ~480ms | 400 QPS | Hop overhead & N+1 bottlenecks |

| Monolithic GraphQL | ~95ms | ~280ms | 700 QPS | Strong mid-load, bottlenecks at scale |

| **GFDE** | **70ms** | **160ms** | **1100 QPS** | ~3Ã— Apollo throughput |

GFDE demonstrates that **federation doesnâ€™t have to mean slow**.

# **Acknowledgments**

This project draws inspiration from:

- Apollo Federation (middleware federation)
- DGraph, Neo4j (graph-native DBs)
- Presto/Trino (distributed query engines)

GFDE builds upon these ideas but pushes federation into the database kernel itself.
